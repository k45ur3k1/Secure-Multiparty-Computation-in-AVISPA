Secure Multiparty Computation also known as Secure Computation, Multi-Party Computation (MPC), or privacy-preserving computation has been one of the most active research areas in both theoretical and applied cryptography. There is multifarious importance of such cryptography protocols as they assure security and integrity of communication or storage. 
There are many applications of MPC such as secure auctions, voting, secure machine learning, BCI(Brain Computer Interface), privacy-preserving network security monitoring, and others. 

In MPC two or more parties collaboratively perform computation on data and receive the resulting output without exposing any party’s private share. The parties involved in computation never learn about any party’s sensitive input, it is necessary and is becoming crucial due to the increase in digitalization. The idea of MPC was first introduced in the early 1980s by Andrew Yao with the millionaires’ problem and was intensively studied for decades. Recently, MPC has become efficient enough to be used in practice and has made the transition from being studied theoretically to a technology being used in industry. 

 Homomorphic encryption allows the users to perform computations on encrypted data. The resulting computations are left in an encrypted form which, when decrypted, results in an identical output to that produced had the operations been performed on the unencrypted data. It is useful in predictive analysis of health care, banking, and voting where the factor of privacy concern of data can now be removed. Service providers can operate on encrypted data and even if the service provider is compromised the data will still be secure as only the party to which the data is intended can decrypt it. 
 
The protocol takes the assumption that the input provided by the parties is scaler data and not matrices. AVISPA tool is used to analyze large-scale Internet security-sensitive protocols and applications for verifying and testing them. 
The protocol is tested for 2 to 5 clients and is scalable. 

About AVISPA Tool:
Avispa stands for Automated Validation of Internet Security-sensitive Protocols and Applications. To devise and analyze a protocol, Avispa provides its own High-Level Protocol Specification Language (HLSPL). The file is saved with an extension of HLSPL. To check security, Avispa translates the provided HLSPL specification in the intermediate format IF, which then can be passed through any of the 4 different verification machines i.e. OFMC, CL-ATSE, SATMC, TA4MC. 

– CL-AtSe: Constraint-Logic-based Attack Searcher. 

– OFMC: the On-the-Fly Model-Checker. 

– SATMC: the SAT-based Model-Checker. 

– TA4SP: the Tree Automata tool based on Automatic Approximations for the Analysis of Security Protocols.
